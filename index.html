        <p>        Taye and Flori are high school students and best friends, and they’re also electronic hip hop duo TUFF PUPIL. After school, they make music about the technology and science they encounter in their lives that they think other kids should know about. Each 5min episode demystifies an everyday phenomenon - how your local pizzeria can predict your order, or how online radio seems to always play the song you were dying to hear. </p>

        
        <p>       TUFF PUPIL introduces STEM topics that are essential to their lives: data science, contagion, climate disruption, clean energy and artificial intelligence. The stories support youth by raising awareness of key concepts that can become a STEM lifeskills toolbox for elementary students.</p>
